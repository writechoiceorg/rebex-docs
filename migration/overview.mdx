The **Tiny SFTP Server** is designed as a minimalist tool for quick, simple file transfer tasks. It requires no installation, runs as a standard desktop application, and is ideal for ad-hoc usage.

However, as your needs evolve, requiring robust security, automation, or multiple user accounts, you may encounter the intentional architectural limits of the Tiny edition. The **Buru SFTP Server** is built to address these advanced scenarios, offering a scalable, secure, and production-ready SFTP solution.

## Security and Authentication

Tiny SFTP Server is designed for testing and simple transfers where high security is not the primary constraint. It stores passwords in a clear-text configuration file and displays the current password directly on the server's main form. Consequently, it is not recommended for use with real passwords or sensitive production environments.

Buru SFTP Server addresses these risks with enterprise-grade features:

<Card title="Secure Storage" icon="shield-check">
Passwords are hashed and securely stored, ensuring they are never kept in clear text.
</Card>
<Card title="Windows Authentication" icon="windows">
Integrate directly with existing Windows user accounts instead of managing separate credentials.
</Card>
<Card title="SSH Support" icon="terminal">
In addition to SFTP, Buru supports the SSH protocol for secure command execution.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Automation and Availability

Tiny SFTP Server runs as a standard Windows desktop application. It requires a user to log in and manually start the executable. If the user logs out or the application is closed, the server stops, making it unsuitable for unattended background operations.

Buru SFTP Server runs as a Windows Service, ensuring:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Auto-Start" icon="power-off">
The server starts automatically with the operating system.
</Card>
<Card title="Background Run" icon="server">
Runs continuously in the background even when no user is logged in.
</Card>
<Card title="High Availability" icon="clock">
Suitable for 24/7 availability requirements.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Scalability 

Tiny SFTP Server is limited to a single user account and a single mapped root directory. This restriction simplifies the configuration for quick tasks but prevents usage in team environments.

Buru SFTP Server is built for growth:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Unlimited Users" icon="users">
Create distinct accounts for different team members or clients.
</Card>
<Card title="Granular Permissions" icon="lock">
Assign different access rights (for example, read-only vs. write access) to specific users.
</Card>
<Card title="Unlimited Mapped Folders" icon="folder-tree">
Configure complex virtual file systems, mapping multiple directories from different locations to a single user session.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Monitoring and Administration

Tiny SFTP Server offers a minimal interface with no detailed logging capabilities. If you need to debug connection issues or audit file access history, the necessary data is not available.

Buru SFTP Server includes management tools:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Log Files" icon="file-lines">
Detailed text logs allow you to monitor server activity and troubleshoot issues.
</Card>
<Card title="Web Administration" icon="browser">
Manage the server remotely via a browser-based dashboard without editing config files manually.
</Card>
<Card title="Command Line" icon="code">
Advanced users can script and automate server management tasks via the CLI.
